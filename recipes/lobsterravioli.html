        <p><strong>For the Sauce</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 shallot thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p><strong>For the Pasta Dough</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the flour in a mound on a clean work surface and make a well in the center. Add the eggs, olive oil, and salt. Begin beating the eggs with a fork to break them up. Slowly start to mix in the flour while beating. Continue until a shaggy mixture forms.</li>
            <li>Working with your hands or a bench scraper, begin folding the mixture together until a dough ball forms. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, sprinkling with additional flour if needed to keep the flour from sticking to your hands or the counter. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>For the Ravioli Filling</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together the lobster, garlic, ricotta, lemon zest, salt, and pepper until combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the pasta dough into quarters and lightly dust with all-purpose flour to keep the pasta from sticking as needed. Roll out each half using a pasta roller, beginning on the largest opening, Number 1, and gradually decreasing to the Number 5 setting. (You can also roll this by hand with a rolling pin to 1/16-inch thick.) Place one dough sheet on a clean work surface, dollop the lobster mixture in 1 tablespoon portions about 1-inch apart. Brush the dough around the filling with water. Top with the other dough sheet, and press around the filling to seal. Cut into squares.</li>
            <li>Place the ravioli on a baking sheet, and refrigerate, uncovered, while continuing. (Ravioli can also be frozen and stored in an airtight container for up to 1 month.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>For the Sauce</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon of salt to a boil over medium-high.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the shallots. Cook, stirring often, until translucent, about 1 minute. Add the wine. Cook, stirring often until reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Whisk in the cream, sage or thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, whisking constantly until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>When the water is boiling, add the chilled ravioli. Cook stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender, about 2 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ravioli to the skillet with the cream sauce. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and return to a simmer, stirring occasionally, adding 2 to 4 tablespoons of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are making your pasta dough, make sure to prepare the dough first, as it's best to give the dough time to rest.</li>
            <li>Make sure to roll the pasta as thin as possible, as homemade fresh pasta dough gets slightly thicker when it cooks.</li>
            <li>When chopping the lobster meat, make sure to chop it finely. This helps you evenly distribute the lobster meat in the filling.</li>
            <li>Before making the ravioli filling, make sure the lobster has completely cooled before mixing the filling and adding it to the pasta.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to overfill your ravioli, or they won't seal properly.</li>
            <li>If you do not have a ravioli cutter, you can use a cookie-cutter. A cookie-cutter will yield the most uniform portions of ravioli. You can use circle, square, heart, or diamond-shaped cookie cutters to change up the shape.</li>
        </ul>
