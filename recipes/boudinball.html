    <h4>Steps for the Boudin Balls</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, heat the oil in a large wide pot over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F/176 C. If you are unable to measure the temperature, add a droplet of batter or flour to the oil. It is ready when the batter sizzles,</li>
            <li>Remove the boudin sausage links from casings and crumble. Mix the meat with extra Cajun seasonings, if desired. This is what is looks like crumbled up.</li>
            <li>Shape the boudin into 1 1/2-inch balls. Depending on the brand of boudin you are using, you may need to squeeze out excess moisture, or sprinkle in some water if it is too dry.</li>
            <li>Fill a shallow bowl with flour, a second bowl with beaten eggs, milk, hot sauce and salt, and a third bowl with breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Coat each Boudin Ball In all three mixtures. First the flour, then the egg, and lastly the breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Fry the boudin balls in the hot oil until golden brown, working in batches. Flip them once half way through if the oil doesn't cover them entirely. You can also use a deep fryer.</li>
            <li>Set onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain some of the oil.</li>

        </ol>
    <h5>Steps for the Creole Mustard</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the sour cream or crema, mustard, lemon juice, Creole seasoning, garlic powder and salt in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
